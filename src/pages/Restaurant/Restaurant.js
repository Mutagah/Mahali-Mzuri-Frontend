            <p>Mahali Mzuri Restaurant is one of Nairobi's most iconic food joints . Its website is a feast for the senses, including bright colors, cheeky line illustrations and mouthwatering food photography. Despite how loud and eye-catching the design system is, the site itself is clean, well-structured and easy to navigate. It shows that restaurant websites do not need to choose between making a splash and being user-friendly.</p>
